[x] handle banned users while they are logged in, when fetching data with their access token
    - 401 can mean many things, from token validity to user status in the server,
    one of them is being permanently banned so what is the best approach to take in the client side,
    we already have code for handling 401 status which most cases means access token has expired,
    but when the access token is revoked or the user has been banned, normally he should be logged out from the server
